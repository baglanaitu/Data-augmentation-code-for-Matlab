# Image-augmentation-code

Data (image) augmentation is a popular technique used in Deep Learning in order to increase the training performance of a model by enlarging the given dataset.
Here I presented code for image augmentation (in the code only 3 types: flipping and rotation to 45, -60 degrees) which can be also modified according to augmentation type.
